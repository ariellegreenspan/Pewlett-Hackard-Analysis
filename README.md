## Summary:
  
  As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, 90398 employees will be needed to fill the roles of those employees who will be retiring. 
Unfortunately, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. There are only 1549 employees eligible for mentoring new employees, which is astronomically less than the number of new employees that need mentoring.
